explain a recursion in a function to a beginner

Recursion is a powerful concept in programming that involves a function calling itself repeatedly until it reaches a specific condition or base case. Here's an example of how recursion works:

Let's say you want to write a function to calculate the factorial of a given number. The factorial of a number is the product of all the positive integers from 1 to that number. For example, the factorial of 5 is 54321 = 120.

To calculate the factorial of a number using recursion, you could write a function like this:

arduino
Copy code
def factorial(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)
Let's break down how this function works:

The factorial function takes an integer n as input.
If n is equal to 1 (the base case), then the function returns 1, since the factorial of 1 is 1.
If n is not equal to 1, the function calculates the factorial of n-1 by calling the factorial function recursively. This means that the factorial function calls itself with a smaller value of n, until it reaches the base case of n=1.
Finally, the function returns n times the factorial of n-1.
So, when you call the factorial function with a number like 5, the function will call itself repeatedly with decreasing values of n until it reaches the base case of n=1. Then, it will return the product of all the numbers from 1 to 5, which is 120.

Recursion can be a little tricky to understand at first, but once you get the hang of it, it can be a very powerful tool for solving complex problems in programming
